Proper protocol demands that every packet be filled with the maximum amout of servers. The maximum packet size should be decided by the server operator and not hardcoded. For the client, you should only accept replies if you specifically sent a packet with the PACKET KEY specified, otherwise discard as this is a spoofed packet. *Only Included if PACKET NUMBER is equal to 1. **To prevent overflows, do not use this specifically, read in each server entry individually.
